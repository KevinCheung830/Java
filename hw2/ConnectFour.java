/*
 * EE3206 Assignment 2
 * 
 * The goal of this assignment is to implement a board game called "Connect Four".
 *
 * This interface contains seven abstract methods that specify the key operations 
 * of the game. You should follow the steps below to create and test the game.
 * 
 * 1. Create a project with the Java package a2223.hw2.
 * 2. Put this interface into the package.
 * 3. Create your own class ConnectFourXXXXXXXX in the same package, where the X-string
 *    is your student ID. The class implements this interface.
 * 4. Implement all abstract methods as required. 
 * 5. Define additional private fields and methods as needed. These fields are for your
 *    internal use and do not form a public API.
 * 6. Define a no-arg constructor. It can be empty but must exist.
 * 7. Run the main method in this interface to test your game implementation.
 *

/**
 * A simple connection board game â€“ Connect Four. The game has two players, X and O, and
 * starts with X. The players take turns dropping their tokens into a six-row, seven-column 
 * vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest 
 * available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to 
 * form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
